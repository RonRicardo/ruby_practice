# Ruby Practice

## Programming is all about trying new things! Use this empty repository to create something.
## Are you more into food than you are Pokemon? Try creating a recipe class. The world is your oyster!

Run ```bundle install``` after you clone the repo!

Objectives:

- Explore class methods
- Explore instance methods
- Where should the single source of truth be? (Do you need one? What is that?)
- What attributes should our instances have?
